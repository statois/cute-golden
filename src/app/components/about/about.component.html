        <h3>About Various Breeds We Do Offer.</h3>
        <p>Exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among America's most popular dog breeds. They are serious
          workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and
          other competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work.
        </p>
        <p>Sturdy, muscular dogs of medium sizes, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its
          name. The broad head, with their friendly and intelligent eyes, short/long ears, and straight muzzle, is a
          breed hallmark. In motion, they move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed
          fanciers say, with a 'merry action.' The most complete records of the development of these breeds are included
          in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced
          Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public
          notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth's great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian
          and sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to
          the stories that had been handed down through generations. These breeds are outgoing, trustworthy, and
          eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and
          maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a
          breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes.
